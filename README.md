# Voidnexa Support

Voidnexa is a rouge-like space exploration game currently in its early alpha stages.

The objective in Voidnexa is to explore the galaxy as much as you can before returning home to Earth to retire. You will have 50,000 hours to do so, if you go past this time limit, it will impact your highscore at the end of your expedition.

As of right now, this game is still heavily in development. The high scores feature should be avaliable soon, but it won't matter that much until version 1.0.
Once version 1.0 is released, then the highscores can become a more competitive experience.
