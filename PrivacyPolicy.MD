This game is built for an offline single player experience, there are no mechanisms built into this application that will share any of your interactions to a private server.

In the foreseeable future, your highschool will be shared with Apple's game center services, but that is as far as your app activity will go.

This app will behave like a good old fashion PC game from the 90s and early 2000s.
